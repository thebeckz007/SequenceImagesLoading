- Grand central Dispatch (GCD): to multithread 
- MVVM architecture: develop application
- Quick, Nimble framework: to write UnitTest
- Follow SOLID principles

## Environment
- XCode 15.0 ++
- iOS 17 ++

## How to run
To run Unit-test, we need to install some libraries from Swift Packages Manager:
- Quick
- Nimble
